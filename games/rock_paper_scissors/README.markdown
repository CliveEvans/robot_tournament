# Rock Paper Scissors

## Objective

This playground game involves two players simultaneously choosing one of the three options 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'. If both choose the same, it's a tie. Otherwise, the following rules apply to determine who won:

  * rock beats scissors
  * scissors beat paper
  * paper beats stone

## Protocol

When called, your robot should respond with one of the following strings:

    rock
    paper
    scissors

That's it. There's no opportunity to learn about your opponent as your program will not remember anything when it's next called. That makes this game really quite stupid, and serves no other purpose than a fun way to warm up and make sure you can build and upload a robot to the tournament.
